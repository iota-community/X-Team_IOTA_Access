## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Access Initiative

The **IOTA Access Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Access](https://link-to-blogpost or article) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

IOTA Access is in phase alpha. A [Minimal Viable Product](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/) (MVP) has been released in October 2020 ([v0.1.0](https://github.com/iotaledger/access-server/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)) We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:

- Feedback
- Documentation
- Code Improvements
- [Chrysalis pt.2](https://blog.iota.org/chrysalis-iota-1-5-phase-2-update-and-next-steps-eecabe55d7bd)  Compatibility

### Feedback

The Feedback goal includes making sure that the MVP is easily usable, has no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn developers off from trying further once they run into them, make sure that the examples we provide are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.
